# This file governs the main CI workflow.
# It's the only workflow triggered on push and pull requests,
# it manages the CI workflow as follows:
# 1. Lint the code aborting the workflow if there are linting errors.
# 2. Determine which files have changed and set job outputs accordingly.
# 3. Conditionally run the other workflows based on the changed files:
#    * stackhpc.yml
#    * extra.yml
#    * trivyscan.yml

        #      We have to use two filters:
        #        * first filter includes all changed files and removes "dev/" files
        #        * second filter explicitly adds 'dev/setup-env.sh'
        #      We use the logical OR of the filters outputs to gate jobs.

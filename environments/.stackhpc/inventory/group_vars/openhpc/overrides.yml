  # below are default in the role, required to get slurm to work:
  - munge
  - mariadb-connector-c # only actually needed on slurmdbd
  - hwloc-libs          # only actuall needed on slurmd
  # below added here to get pingpong and pingmatrix hpctests working:
  - mpitests-openmpi

# define paths to slurm on NFS clients:
openhpc_sbin_dir: /nopt/slurm/23.02.5/sbin
openhpc_lib_dir: /nopt/slurm/23.02.5/lib/slurm
openhpc_bin_dir: /nopt/slurm/23.02.5/bin
openhpc_slurm_conf_path: /nopt/slurm/etc/slurm.conf

# modify slurm.conf:
openhpc_config_extra:
  SlurmctldDebug: debug
  SlurmdDebug: debug
  Epilog: '<absent>' # required b/c the default slurm.conf uses an Epilog provided by openhpc pkgs

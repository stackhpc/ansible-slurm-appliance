# This file provides examples of using freeipa role variables. These are NOT functional in CI as freeipa_{server,client} groups are not defined.

# NB: Users defined this way have expired passwords
freeipa_users:
  - name: demo_user # can't use rocky as $HOME isn't shared!
    password: "{{ test_demo_user_password }}"
    givenname: test
    sn: test

# freeipa_client hosts must use a FreeIPA server for name resolution - requires hosts to be in group `resolv_conf`.
resolv_conf_nameservers:
  - "{{ hostvars[groups['freeipa_server'].0].ansible_host }}"

block_devices
=============

Manage filesystems on block devices, including creating partitions, creating filesystems and mounting filesystems.

This is a convenience wrapper around the ansible modules:
- community.general.parted
- community.general.filesystem
- ansible.buildin.file
- ansible.posix.mount

It includes logic to handle OpenStack-provided volumes appropriately both for appliance instances and the Packer build VM.

To avoid issues with device names changing after e.g. reboots, devices are identified by serial number and mounted by filesystem UUID. 

Requirements
------------

N/A.

Role Variables
--------------

- `block_devices_partition_state`: Optional. Partition state, 'present' or 'absent' (as for parted) or 'skip'. Defaults to 'present'.
- `block_devices_serial`: Required. Serial number of block device. For an OpenStack volume this is the volume ID.
- `block_devices_number`: Required. Partition number, e.g 1 for "/dev/sda1". See `community.general.parted:number`.
- `block_devices_fstype`: Required. Filesystem type, e.g.'ext4'. See `community.general.filesystem:fstype`
- `block_devices_resizefs`: Optional. Grow filesystem into block device space, 'yes' or 'no' (default). See `community.general.filesystem:resizefs` for applicable fileysystem types.
- `block_devices_filesystem_state`: Optional. Whether filesystem should be 'present' (default) or 'absent', or 'skip'.
- `block_devices_path`: Required. Path to mount point, e.g. '/mnt/files'.
- `block_devices_mount_state`: Optional. Mount state, 'absent', 'mounted' (default), 'present', 'unmounted' or 'remounted' - see `ansible.posix.mount:state`
- `block_devices_owner`: Optional. Name of owner for mounted directory (as for `ansible.buildin.file:owner`), or omitted.
- `block_devices_group`: Optional. Name of group for mounted directory (as for `ansible.buildin.file.group`), or omitted.

Multiple NFS client/server configurations may be provided by defining `block_devices_configurations`. This should be a list of mappings with keys/values are as per the variables above without the `block_devices_` prefix. Omitted keys/values are filled from the corresponding variable.

Dependencies
------------

See top of page.

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - include_role:
    name: block_devices
```

The example variables below create an `ext4` partition on `/dev/sdb1` and mount it as `/mnt/files` with the default owner/group:

```yaml
block_devices_serial: a1076455-da55-4e0c-bac8-ccc4698cff97
block_devices_number: 1
block_devices_fstype: ext4
block_devices_path: /mnt/files
```

This does the same:

```yaml
block_devices_configurations:
  - serial: a1076455-da55-4e0c-bac8-ccc4698cff97
    number: 1
    fstype: ext4
    path: /mnt/files
```

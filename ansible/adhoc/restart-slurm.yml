# Restart all slurm daemons e.g. after changing configuration. Note that:
# - `scontrol reconfigure` will handle most reconfiguration - see https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html#OPT_reconfigure
#   for which options need a restart
# - Adding or removing nodes by changing the `openhpc_` configuration and rerunning ansible/site.yml will automatically
#   restart daemons as required.

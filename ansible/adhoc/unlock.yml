# Unlock cluster instances

# A manual run is required before any action which will modify instances:
# - ansible-playbook ansible/adhoc/rebuild.yml
# - tofu apply
# - tofu destroy
# e.g.:
#   ansible-playbook ansible/adhoc/lock.yml
#
# Instances are automatically locked by site.yml and unlocked by ansible/adhoc/rebuild-via-slurm.yml

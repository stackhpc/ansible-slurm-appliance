# Rebuild hosts with a specified image from OpenStack.
# 
# Use ansible's -v output to see output.
# Use --limit to control which hosts to rebuild (either specific hosts or the <cluster_name>_<partition_name> groups defining partitions).
# Optionally, supply `-e rebuild_image=<image_name_or_id>` to define a specific image, otherwise the current image is reused.
#
# NOTE: If a hostvar `instance_id` is defined this is used to select hosts. Otherwise the hostname is used and this must be unique, which may not be the case e.g. if using identically-named staging and production hosts.
#
# Example:
#   ansible-playbook -v --limit ohpc_compute ansible/adhoc/rebuild.yml -e rebuild_image=openhpc_v2.3
